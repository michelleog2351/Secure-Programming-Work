# Calculator-Project
Calculator Unit Test Starter Code

# Set Up Your Environment:
  
1.	Clone/download the starter calculator project.
2.	Import the project into your chosen IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

# Review the Calculator Class:
1. Examine the code in Calculator.java to understand what each method does.
2. Note that the divide() method throws an exception if the divisor is zero.

# Write Unit Tests:
1. Open the CalculatorTest.java file in the test folder.
2. Complete any missing test methods or add additional tests if you wish.
3. Use the JUnit 5 assertions (assertEquals, assertThrows, etc.) to verify the expected behaviour of each method.
4. Ensure that each test method is annotated with @Test.

# Run Your Tests:
1. Use your IDEâ€™s test runner.
2. In VS Code you will need to install the extension: Test Runner for Java
3. Verify that all tests pass successfully. If any test fails, review your implementation in the Calculator class and your test cases.

# Extra Challenge (Optional):
1. Add some more methods to Calculator.java
2. Add the corresponding Tests
